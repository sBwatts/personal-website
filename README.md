## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) 1.4+
- [R](https://www.r-project.org/) with `yaml` package
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) with packages: `requests`, `pyyaml`

### Preview locally

```bash
quarto preview
```

The site will be available at `http://localhost:4848` with live reload.

### Full build

```bash
quarto render
```

Output goes to `docs/` (committed and served by GitHub Pages).

## Publication Pipeline

Publications are managed through two layers:

1. **Auto-sync** (`open-alex.py`): Fetches the latest publications from the [OpenAlex API](https://openalex.org/) using ORCID `0000-0002-5108-9055`, then writes `data/publications.csv` and `_bibliography/papers.bib`, and generates/removes individual article pages under `research/articles/` and `research/working-papers/`.

2. **Manual pages**: Publication pages not returned by OpenAlex (e.g., works not claimed under your ORCID) are tracked in git and preserved. To add OpenAlex coverage for missing works, claim them at [openalex.org](https://openalex.org/).

To manually sync publications locally:

```bash
python open-alex.py
```

The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/update-publications.yml`) runs this automatically on the 1st and 15th of each month, then commits and pushes any changes to `data/`.

## CV Updates

The CV is a PDF generated from `cv/cv.Rmd` using R and TinyTeX. To update:

1. Edit `cv/cv.Rmd`
2. Run `Rscript cv/cv_render.R` to produce `cv/cv.pdf`
3. Commit and push `cv/cv.pdf`

## Deployment

The site deploys automatically via GitHub Actions:

- **`deploy.yml`** — Installs Quarto + R, runs `quarto render`, and deploys `docs/` to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`.
- No manual build step needed — push to `main` and the site updates.
